## 8/11 - 3rd Friday of Internship

Good Morning John. I hope you are doing well. Just wanted to summarize what I did this week.

### Nomenclature

- **Passive Task:** Tasks that have an abstract deadline or can be easily done at any time at convenience.
- **Active Task:** Associated with strict deadlines, but sometimes doesn't have to be (like a main project).
I am wondering what words Curacao and you use as a substitute.

### Schedule Summary

(Note: to fill in time, I studied node.js every day)

- **Monday:** Hotjar + Standup meeting
- **Tuesday:** Hotjar
- **Wednesday:** Hotjar + Meeting with Amilcar + Standup meeting
- **Thursday:** Hotjar + Setup CATO VPN + Pete Project
- **Friday:** Hotjar + Amilcar meeting + Pete Project + Front-end Amilcar project

### Stats

- Over 200-300 Hotjar videos scrutinized
- Edited cosmetics on Curacao production environment.

### Task Management

- **Passive Tasks:** Hotjar + Pete's Excel categorization and one
- **Active Task:** Deploy front-end changes on Amilcar's command.

### Last Message

Iâ€™m willing to take on more responsibilities if you have any, especially in relation to development.
I hope you have a good weekend (migraine-free).
